About
-----

ShopZy is short for Shop Easy. It is an online marketplace that allows individuals or business to place their product and wait for offers to buy them.
ShopZy facilitate the hassle to get customers and allow more exposure as well because all transactions are done remotely.

### Individual example
An individual can have an iphone5 and wants to upgrade to an iphone6, he can easily do so buy selling is iphone5 on the platform for a secure and easy transaction.Following that add some savings on top of the cash won to get is iphone6.He can even do so buy looking for that product on the platform as well.

### Business example
For a business it is even better. The business get the opportunity to reach a wider market by being online. Also it helps customers that maybe don't have transport fees to still purchase in the comfort of their home. It eliminates competions because a customer doesn't have to go from shop to shop just looking for an item he can do so online. Once a business get a customer it is easier for it to keep him.

These are just simple example of the benefits and how `ShopZy` works.
